📊 Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
An intelligent customer segmentation system built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and K-Means Clustering. This project helps businesses understand their customers better by clustering them into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior and demographics.

🚀 Features
✅ K-Means Clustering for unsupervised learning
✅ Data Preprocessing including scaling & outlier removal
✅ Optimal Cluster Selection using Elbow Method
✅ Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
✅ Easy to Extend for any customer-related dataset

🛠️ Tech Stack
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Clustering: Scikit-learn (KMeans)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Notebook Tool: Jupyter Notebook

🧠 How It Works
Jupyter Notebook (customer segmentation k means clustering.ipynb)
Loads and explores customer dataset

Preprocesses features with scaling and cleaning

Uses Elbow Method to determine optimal k

Applies KMeans Clustering on selected features

Visualizes clustered customer segments

Provides insights for business strategy
