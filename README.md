## 🚀 Features

✅ **K-Means Clustering** for segmentation  
✅ **Visual Insights** using Seaborn & Matplotlib  
✅ **Elbow Method** to determine optimal clusters  
✅ **Cleaned & Scaled Dataset**  
✅ **Business-Driven Analysis** based on clusters

## 🧠 How It Works

### Jupyter Notebook (`customer_segmentation_kmeans.ipynb`)

* Loads and cleans customer data  
* Uses the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters  
* Applies the **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**  
* Visualizes segmented customer clusters using scatter plots  
* Interprets customer groups for business use cases
